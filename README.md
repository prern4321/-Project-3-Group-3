# Description of Project:

-	Why did we choose the project?
-	What were we aiming to do?


# Data Set:

After conducting a thorough review of available data sets, we have identified and selected the following three datasets for further analysis:

1.	NHS public data from the UK Government: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/73740ffe-cecb-4cba-afb9-51ea996187a1/nhs-england-nhs-choices-hospitals-patient-comments-and-ratings   
2.	NHS Public Data from the UK Government: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity/2020-21#resources    
3.	Hospital Data in England from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manchunhui/uk-hospitals

Following our selection process, we have chosen to utilise the geospatial data of the UK NHS Hospital Database available on Kaggle. The dataset was downloaded in CSV format and subsequently cleaned and pre-processed for analytical and visualisation purposes.

The Kaggle dataset was selected due to its relevance to the aims of our project, specifically the requirement for geospatial data to create interactive visualisations, such as a map displaying the locations of hospitals in England. The dataset closely fits these requirements and was therefore deemed the most suitable option.

## Preview of Dataset

[![Datasetpreview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111789352/211102761-1359c402-7280-46a2-989f-ddffca7f219d.png)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manchunhui/uk-hospitals)




While the dataset includes a large amount of information, our focus was on the hospital ID/name, location, and type (NHS/non-independent sector or Private/independent sector). These specific details were necessary for the purposes of our analysis.

Aim of the project :
To be able to locate the hospitals on the map , hospitals with the county and their type (private/nhs) across the counties. Our focus was primarily to  build our knowledge on getting the different technologies to work together to create interactive visualizations.

# Technology used:
Flask, Javascript,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap, Pandas , Sqlalchemy,SQL



# JS Library
CanvasJs

After conducting a review of various JavaScript libraries, we evaluated both HighCharts and CanvasJS. After testing, we ultimately chose to proceed with CanvasJS as it effectively met the requirements of our project. Mainly for its ability to create rich interactive and easily animated dashboards. Also, for its portability across devices and ability to be supported by major browsers.



# Coding logic 
Please note the code was witten in chunks so it is easier to run and debug
